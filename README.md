# Chapel Performance Suite

The Chapel Performance Suite is a port of
[RAJAPerf](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf) to Chapel. It serves as a drop-in
replacement for RAJAPerf, enabling the reference implementations of the latter
to be directly compared to Chapel implementations. Despite being in its early
stages, we hope ChapelPerf may be used to (i) evaluate the performance of
Chapel compared to alternative parallel programming models, (ii) assess the
performance of Chapel on different system architectures, and (iii) help direct
optimisation efforts to make Chapel increasingly competitive on the HPC scene.
